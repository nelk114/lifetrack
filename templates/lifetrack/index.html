        <h5>About us</h5>
        <p>We (four passionate computer science students — Kseniia, Aman, Nico, and Tanishaa) created LifeTrack to make habit tracking simple, effective, and accessible for everyone. 
           Inspired by our own struggles to stay consistent with routines, we developed LifeTrack to help people take control of their daily habits and achieve their personal goals.
           With a shared vision of empowering individuals to live intentionally, our team combined technical skills and creativity to build a platform that’s both user-friendly and powerful.
           LifeTrack is more than just a tool, it’s a reflection of our commitment to helping others create meaningful, lasting change in their lives.
           Join us on this journey, and let LifeTrack help you turn your routines into rules that work for you!</p>

            I’ve tried a few habit-tracking apps before, but LifeTrack stands out because of its simplicity and flexibility. 
            My only suggestion would be to add more social features to share progress with friends. Great job overall!
