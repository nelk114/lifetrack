A Habit Tracking Web App.
Primarily for University Coursework purposes.
More info to be added by someone more eloquent than I.

Requires Python & Django
(building and testing against versions 3.11 and 2.2.28 respectively).
To actually run anything you'll need to make the db migrations
(they're intentionally excluded from comitting as they're autogenerated):
in the project's basedir
(& with the relevant virtualenv active)
do
`python manage.py makemigrations` then `python manage.py migrate`.
Obviously as developm't continues
this'll only be necessary if the models change
(or if reiÌˆnstalling fsr)
